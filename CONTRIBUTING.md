## Contributing

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. 
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Maker ToolBox's `master` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
